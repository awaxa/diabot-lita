# diabot

Our fourth generation irc bot, now using the [Lita.io](https://www.lita.io) framework.  This follows a hubot, which succeeded a supybot, after a perl script.  The primary function is to convert blood glucose values between mg/dl and mmol/l to encourage more frequent fingersticking and sharing of blood glucose values within a group that uniquely understands the meaning of these numbers.

[heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) is configured to deploy the master branch automatically.  Merge with caution.
